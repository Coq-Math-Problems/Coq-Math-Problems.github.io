This blog is intended to present simple mathematical problems, where providing constructive and fully formalized solutions presents a fun challenge. My intention is that each problem should be solvable in little time with a little bit of effort and creativity. Throughout this blog, I will stick to using the proof assistant Coq.

Each problem will be presented with an explanation as well as a template Coq file providing the necessary definitions and goals.  After about a week or so, I'll submit a Coq file containing a solution along with a detailed explanation.

Any feedback or suggestions for problems is very much welcome.
