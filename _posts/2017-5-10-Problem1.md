title: "Problem #1: Valleys in decreasing functions"
---

*[Problem #1 Template](https://github.com/Coq-Math-Problems/Problems/blob/master/P1/P1_template.v)*

Let `f : nat -> nat` be a decreasing function.  Here, we mean decreasing in the non-strict sense (and indeed, no strictly decreasing functions `nat -> nat` exist).

*Your typical decreasing function*

Classically, we can prove that `f` must eventually be constant, i.e. there is a position after which the value of `f` never changes.  Unfortunately, this cannot be proven constructively (we will revisit this in Problem #2), but we can prove something weaker.  By an `n`-valley, we will mean a sequence of `n+1` consecutive points that have the same value.  For example, in the above figure, there is a `3`-valley at position `x=4`.

**Problem**: Show that for any decreasing `f` and natural number `n`, there is an `n`-valley somewhere in `f`.
