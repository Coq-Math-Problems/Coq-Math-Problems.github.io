title: "Problem #3: Finite cancellative semigroups"
---

*[Problem #3 Template](https://github.com/Coq-Math-Problems/Problems/blob/master/P3/P3_template.v)*

A common elementary exercise in abstract algebra is to show that a finite [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) with the [cancellation property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellation_property) is in fact a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)).  Perhaps less known is that one can weaken the assumption of a monoid to a [semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup), provided of course that the semigroup is non-empty.

In constructive mathematics, you have to be careful about what precisely you mean by 'finite'.  For the purposes of this problem, the most natural notion of finiteness is that of Dedekind-finiteness.  We will say that a set `X` is Dedekind-finite if every injection `X -> X` is also a surjection.

**Problem**: Given a Dedekind-finite semigroup which is inhabited and satisfies the cancellation property, construct an identity and inverse operation, and prove that they satisfy their respective group laws.
